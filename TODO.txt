Last pb :
- Cas de grille 1


BSQ :

================================================== NOPE
- get the input from a file or the standard input
* either ac > 1							OK
* either read from stdin				NOPE if multiple files (cat x, y)

================================================== OK
- translate the input into a chained list
* main -> init_chained

================================================= NOPE - BUG
- check that the data are correct
=> identify chars used					OK
=> size min is good						NOPE when should return 0
=> each char matches the used ones		OK
=> each line has the same length		OK

================================================= OK
- mesure the size (length & height) of the grid from the chained list with \n
* pre_resolution -> map_is_correct (call to other functions in an other file)
 + get_x_max
 + get_y_max

================================================ OK
- convert the chained list into an array of char*
=> pre_resolution -> convert_chained
 + dealloc : to free the chained list as it is unused from now on
=> make sure to get rid of the \n => \0 maybe

================================================ NOPE
- begin resolution : find the biggest square which origin will be the char we 
look at
=> analyse => biggest_square_from_pos : will get the size of the biggest 
square without obstacles from the (x,y) pos. given in parameter -> upper left
corner
 + a function to manage calls to biggest_square_from_pos for all positions

=============================================== NOPE
- rewrite the grid : all char in the previously found square will be replaced
with 'x' or whatever
=> analyse -> fill_map : will replace all blank char with 'x'

=============================================== NOPE
- display the grid on stdout
=> FUNCTION NEEDED to print the grid

=============================================== NOPE
=> start again for each file in parameter
- loop in main.c
